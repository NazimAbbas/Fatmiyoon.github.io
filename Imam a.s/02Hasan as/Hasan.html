<p><b>Ali ibn Abi Talib (Arabic: عَلِيّ ٱبْن أَبِي طَالِب‎, ʿAlī ibn ʾAbī Ṭālib; 13 September 601 – 29 January 661) 
  was a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who ruled as the fourth
   caliph from 656 until his assassination in 661. He is one of the central figures in Shia Islam and is regarded as the
   rightful immediate successor to Muhammad as an Imam by Shia Muslims.</b>
  <i> Tradition states that Ali was born inside the Kaaba in Mecca,and was a member of the Quraysh tribe. Ali's father 
    and Muhammad's uncle, Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, was custodian of the Kaaba and a sheikh of the Banu Hashim, an important
     branch of the powerful tribe of the Quraysh. His mother, Fatimah bint Asad, was also from the Banu Hashim. In Arab culture it was
      a great honor for Ali that both of his parents belonged to the Banu Hashim. Ali was also one of descendants of Ishmael (Isma'il) the son of Abraham (Ibrahim). </i></p>

          During his childhood, Ali spent his first six years under his father's roof. Then, 
          as a result of famine in and around Mecca, Muhammad asked his uncle, Abu Talib, to
           allow Ali to come and live in the house of his cousin. It would be another four
            years until Muhammad would announce his Prophethood.Ali migrated to Medina shortly
             after Muhammad. There Muhammad told Ali that he had been ordered by God to give his 
             daughter, Fatimah, to Ali in marriage. For the ten years that Muhammad led the community 
             in Medina, Ali was extremely active in his service, leading parties of warriors on raids, and 
             carrying messages and orders. With the exception of the Battle of Tabouk, Ali took part in all
              the battles fought for Islam during this time.
