     he was a prophet, sent to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam,</i> .</p>Abraham, Moses, Jesus,
      and other prophets. He is believed to be the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam,
       though some modern denominations diverge from this belief. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, 
       with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief.</p>

    Born approximately 570 CE (Year of the Elephant) in the Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six.[6]
     He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, and upon his death, by his uncle Abu Talib.[7]
      In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, 
      Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave[8][9] and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613,[10] Muhammad started
       preaching these revelations publicly,[11] proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God[12] is the right way
        of life (dīn),[13] and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.
