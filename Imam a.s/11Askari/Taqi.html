<p><strong>The Tenth Imam
  Ali b. Muhammad al-Hadi (a.s) is the tenth Shi‘a Imam. His father was 
   Muhammad b. Ali al-Jawad (a.s) and his mother was a woman named Sumanah.
   He was born in the village of Sarya on the outskirts of Madinah in the month 
   of Rajab 212/827. Historical sources describe Imam al-Hadi (a.s) as being of
    medium height and having a very dark complexion, similar to his father Imam 
    al-Jawad (a.s) and grandfather Imam al-Ridha (a.s).<br><br>

        The tenth Imam was known by many titles which designated his virtuous
         qualities. Two of the most famous of these titles were al-Hadi 
         (the guide) and al-Naqi (the pure).

    

     <br>

     Imam al-Hadi (a.s) had to bear great responsibilities at a very young
      age due to the fact his father Imam al-Jawad (a.s) was summoned to Baghdad
       from Madinah when Imam al-Hadi (a.s) was no older than six years old. 
       While his father was in Baghdad, Imam al-Hadi (a.s) took his place in 
       Madinah, running his affairs. Less than a year later his father died,
        leaving him to assume the position of Imamate..
        Imam al-Hadi (a.s) was a very humble man. His wealth of 
        knowledge and great social standing increased his popularity 
        among lay people, who believed that he truly reflected the behavior encouraged by Islam.

          Imam al-Hadi (a.s), who lived in Madinah for most of his life,
           was summoned by Abbasid ruler al-Mutawakkil to the capital at the 
           time, Samarra. Al-Mutawakkil wanted to have Imam al-Hadi (a.s) under 
           constant monitoring as he feared that he would lead an armed rebellion
           st the Abbasid government. Imam al-Hadi (a.s) spent the remainder of
            his life in Samarra and is reported to have been poisoned by either 
            al-Mutawakkil, or his son al-Mu‘tamid.

Imam al-Hadi (a.s) died at the age of forty in 254AH/868AD
