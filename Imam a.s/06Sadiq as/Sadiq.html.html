<p><strong>The sixth Imam Ja’far b. Muhammad al-Sadiq (a.s), who is often remembered as the pioneer
   of the Madhhab (hence the oft-used term “Ja’fari”), was born in the Holy City of Madinah in the
    Year 83 A.H (702 A.D) to his father, the fifth Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s) and his mother, Umm 
    Farwa b. Qasim b. Muhammad b. Abi Bakr.. 
    The Imam was recognised for being the most astute and knowledgeable of his father’s children.
     Much like his father, he benefitted significantly from the changing times which allowed him to
      spread the teachings of Islam openly. It is believed that thousands of students of Hadith 
      (Prophetic sayings) would gather around Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) in the Holy City of Madinah and 
      learn directly from him..
     <br>

   
     During this period, the teachings of original Islam as taught by the Ahlulbayt spead 
     extensively, and under the guidance of Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) numerous students were produced
      who could debate and overcome the scholars of other schools of thought in Islam. These 
      scholars included men such as Hisham b. Hakam, Hisham b. Salim al-Jawaliqi, Zurarah b. 
      ‘Ayun and others.</strong> </p>

          However, Imam al-Sadiq’s (a.s) legacy was not merely confined to the field of pioneering
           the religious sciences. Rather, under his period of Imamate, the natural sciences also 
           flourished. Men like Jabir b. Hayyan, who was known for his skills in sciences such as
            chemistry, would carry the name of their teacher Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) into the world of
             the natural sciences as well as other fields of human learning.

The Imam passed away in the year 148 A.H, leaving the mantle of Imamah for his son, Imam Musa b.
 Ja’far (a.s).
