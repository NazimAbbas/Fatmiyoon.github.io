<p><b>Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin (Arabic: عَلِيّ ٱبْن ٱلْحُسَيْن زَيْن ٱلْعَابِدِين‎), also known as al-Sajjad
   (Arabic: ٱلسَّجَّاد‎, "The Consistently Prostrating") or simply Zayn al-Abidin (Arabic: زَيْن ٱلْعَابِدِين‎, 
   "Adornment of the Worshippers"), (c. 4 January 659 – c. 20 October 713) was the fourth Imam in Shiʻi
    Islam after his father Husayn ibn Ali, his uncle Hasan ibn Ali, and his grandfather, Ali. He was born,
     according to some sources, from Shahrbanu.

  Ali was just one of three boys called Ali, in his family. The two others were killed in The Battle
   of Karbala, one of them just an infant. Zayn al-Abidin survived the Battle, since he was ill, and 
   did not participate in the battle. Later on he was sent to Kufa along with surviving women and 
   children. In Kufa, he was about to be killed by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, who disdained him by saying 
   that God killed his family. Ali ibn Husayn, condemned ibn Ziad, by quoting a verse of Quran, which s
    otherwise.</b>
  <i> Ali, then was sent to Damascus, where he had a Sermon at Yazid I's palace, in presence 
    of people who Yazid expected to take his side. In this sermon, Ali introduced himself and his
     family as Ahl al-Bayt of the prophet of Islam who were killed by Muslims!.</i></p>
